## Summary

Climate change is widely acknowledged to be one of the most pressing global issues facing society today. As it has been noted that organizations’ supply chain networks are major contributors to this environmental impact, companies are taking steps to reduce their carbon footprint. Although attempts have been made by supply chain leaders to track carbon emissions, current state solutions do not provide real-time reporting and are often inaccurate (Chen et al., 2022; Fang et al., 2018). In March 2020, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in the United States issued a proposal that would require public companies to disclose climate-related information in their SEC filings. As organizations will look to their supply chain leaders to provide this information, these leaders will need tools to provide transparency across their supply chain networks.

As researchers have voiced concerns regarding proof-of-work blockchain protocols such as Bitcoin due to high electricity consumption, protocols such as VeChain could have a positive impact on the environment. VeChain is an enterprise-focused solution that is focused on providing a secure, reliable, and scalable platform for enterprise applications, namely within the supply chain industry (Schahczenski & Schahczenski, 2020). Additionally, in a recent Bankless interview (https://youtu.be/9FZq-9Oe5Hc), Paul Brody, the Global Blockchain Leader for Ernst & Young, mentioned a number of use cases EY is working on to increase transparency across supply chain networks. With the current work being done in both the Web2 and Web3 spaces in integrating blockchain and supply chain, the team is looking to develop a future-state framework.

The purpose of this qualitative modified Delphi study is to identify a consensus among a panel of supply chain executives as to the desirability and feasibility of a platform to track carbon emissions. From a sustainability perspective, we also look to gain insights as to whether they would use this tool due to regulation or for positive environmental impact. 


### Main field of research

Empirical studies / real-world measurements / performance analysis &amp; comparison

### Keywords

Sustainability; Supply Chain; Blockchain; Carbon emissions; Environmental, social, and corporate governance (ESG)

### Approach

A modified qualitative Delphi approach was selected because Justin Goldston used this approach in the past for a study to identify a consensus among a panel of ERP manufacturing consultants as to the desirability and feasibility of critical success factors in ERP implementations in the United States. In using supply chain executives as the panel of experts in this study, not only will we hopefully gain insights as to the needs of the user base for a blockchain-based carbon solution.

In this study, the team will look to answer the following research questions:

RQ1. What are the current challenges facing the supply chain industry in terms of carbon emissions and how can blockchain address these challenges?

Justification: In order to develop a solution leaders will use, we must solve an industry problem. Interviews with individuals such as Paul Brody of EY and Sheri Hinish - Global Consulting Lead for Sustainability Services at IBM - will be performed to develop the survey instrument, hence the modified Delphi approach. While the team has yet to identify existing survey instruments for surveys based around blockchain-based carbon solutions, we will confirm that a survey currently does not exist.

RQ2. What are the potential benefits and limitations of a blockchain-based carbon solution for the supply chain industry?

Justification: In having discussions with supply chain leaders over the years on the feasibility of blockchain-based solutions within the industry, the consensus is that hybrid solutions may be needed for industry-wide adoption. As the benefits will allow for ease of auditing that will be coming for public entities, the limitations may be due to the fact that some blockchain solutions do not provide hybrid offerings to organizations. Platforms such as the Casper Network are noting they are creating hybrid solutions focused on enterprise adoption, and this solution will be reviewed in this study.

RQ3. How can a blockchain-based carbon solution be implemented in the supply chain industry?

Justification: Using Goldston's Critical Success Factors in Enterprise Resource Planning Implementation in U.S. Manufacturing as the foundation, we will look at the existing research and depend upon the experts to assess whether blockchain-based implementations are similar to ERP implementations for organizations that operate within the supply chain industry.

RQ4. What are the implications of a blockchain-based carbon solution for the supply chain industry in terms of cost, efficiency, and environmental impact?

Justification: Based on the protocol and platform, cost, efficiency, and environmental impact will vary. We will assess solutions such as VeChain, Ethereum, ICP, Cudos, and Casper to perform a comparison of viable protocols supply chain solutions could potentially build a blockchain-based carbon solution on. An interesting topic in this research question would be the environmental impact of NFT minting as the team feels the supply chain industry may provide the greatest opportunity for the integration of NFTs within the space. For example, similar to how ERP systems generate lot numbers for batches of products, serial numbers for individual serialized products, as well as individual identifiers for totes and containers, in the Web3 (or Web2.5) world, if the item has a serial or batch number, it will be a minted NFT. As analysts and researchers have speculated that NFTs have a negative impact on the envirnoment, the team will also research the use of NFTs to track and trace raw materials, sub-assemblies, and finished goods. It will also be valuable to understand the thoughts of supply chain leaders on the environmental impact of using NFTs to track and trace goods and whether that will impact their decision-making to use NFTs as a tracking and tracing mechanism.  

### Risks

The potential risk to this project could be the lack of responses among the panel of experts. As Justin Goldston is a part of many blockchain-related supply chain groups on LinkedIn, this risk could be considered a small risk.
